# Contributing to XED Metadata

Thank you for your interest in contributing to XED Metadata! We're building free, permissionless infrastructure for the Solana ecosystem, and your contributions help make this possible.

## 🎯 Our Mission

XED Metadata exists to eliminate the $300 paywall that prevents projects from updating their token metadata. We believe infrastructure should be free and accessible to everyone.
